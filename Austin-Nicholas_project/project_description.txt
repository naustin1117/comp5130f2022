My goal for this project was to create a marketplace for used PC parts similar to Ebay or SidelineSwap.
I did some research when deciding on a project and found that there aren't very many marketplaces that enable people
to sell their old computers and electronics. I wanted to create a web application for this but had 
to make a decision of what framework I would use to accomplish this task.
I wrote my research paper on a few different frameworks such and Vue, React and Angular. I decided
to go with React. Based on my research it was something that was easy to start out with and wasn't full
stack like Angular so there wasn't as much learning needed to get started. Also, I chose React over 
Vue because while they both are lightweight and easy to use front-end frameworks, React is a bit older 
and there is more information and guides out there to help new people get started.
Because of my lack of experience things took me much longer than expected. However,
I still really enjoyed this project and was able to play around with
various techonologies that I have never used previously. This was my first full stack application that
I had ever made and I probably bit off a bit more than I could chew. Because of this the application 
probably seems like it is somewhat incomplete which it is because I still have some finishing touches
that I need to work out. However, all and all I feel that I learned a lot on this project and learned
more about Databases and backend, animation and improved my React skills along with becoming more well
versed in css styling.
