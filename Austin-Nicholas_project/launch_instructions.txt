Here are my detailed instructions to get started.
1. To start you need to install node.js on your machine. The download for this can be 
found at https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Once you do that you need to pull my project folder onto your local machine and go to the directory. 
3. Once you have done this there are a few dependencies that need to be installed using npm.
4. To install these packages just type in the command "npm install <package name>" into your terminal.
5. The packages you need to install are:
    - axios
    - bcrypt
    - concurrently
    - cors
    - fortawesome
    - framer-motion
    - nodejs
    - react-dom
    - react-fontawesome
    - react-icons
    - react-router-dom
    - react-scripts
    - styled-components
6. Once you have installed all the dependencies simply type "npm run dev" this should start
the server and the react application.
7. If this fails it should tell you if you are missing a dependencies. If you are
just run "npm install <package name>" and then try again. 
8. If it isn't working but not saying you are missing a dependencies it could be because you are using 
a different OS than I used to develop. This happened to me when I switched from Windows 10 computer to Mac.
To remedy this situation simply run "rm -rf ./node_modules" and then run "npm run dev" again. Hopefully this
will fix any issues you run into.
