Here are my detailed instructions to get started.
1. To start you need to install node.js on your machine. The download for this can be 
found at https://nodejs.org/en/
2. Once you do that you need to pull my project folder onto your local machine and go to the directory. 
3. Once you have done this there are a few dependencies that need to be installed using npm.
4. To install these packages just type in the command "npm install" into your terminal. This
should install all necesarry packages to run the application. 
5. Once you have installed all the dependencies simply type "npm run client" this should start
the server and the react application.
6. If this fails it should tell you if you are missing a dependencies. If you are
just run "npm install <package name>" and then try again.
