Using the application should be self explanatory.
Simply Create an Account. This should automatically sign you in and then 
using the nav bar you should be able to create a new listing. 
This form doesn't have any checks because I didn't have the time
to implement it. However, simply add an image file, Price and Title
and then click submit. 
You then will be able to see your listing on the home page.
